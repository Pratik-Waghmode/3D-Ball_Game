# 3D BALL GAME

The main objective of this game is to collect the coins
and increase the score which can be displayed on the screen
through a UI Canvas. The User (Player) has to control the
ball with the ”wasd” keys and use a ”spacebar” to jump when
needed. The Ball will be dropped on a thin platform and the
player has to move along the platform. If the player looses
the control and the ball falls off the platform the game is
over and the player has to restart.
